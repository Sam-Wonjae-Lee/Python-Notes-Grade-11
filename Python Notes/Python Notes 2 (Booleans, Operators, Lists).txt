bool(): Booleans give two outcomes -> True or False.
- Any string is True, except empty strings.
- Any number is True, except 0.
- Any list, tuple, set, and dictionary are True, except empty ones.

Arithmetic Operators:
+: Addition
-: Subtraction
*: Multiplication
/: Division
%: Modulus -> gives the remainder.
**: Exponentiation -> a^b
//: Floor Division -> rounds down the answer, and returns a whole number.

Comparison Operators:
==: Equal
!=: Not equal
>, <: Greater or lesser than
>=, <=: Greater or lesser than or equal to

Logical Operators:
and: Returns True if both statements are true
or: Returns True if one of the statements is true
not: Returns False if the result is true

Identity Operators: Used to compare objects
is: Returns True if both variables are the same object
is not: Returns True if both variables are not the same object

x = ["apple", "banana"]
y = ["apple", "banana"]

print(x is y)

-> False
x is not y because x is not the same object as y, even if they have the same content.

Membership Operators: Test if a sequence is presented in an object
in: Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object
not in: Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object

x = ["apple", "banana"]

print("banana" in x)

-> True

Assignment Operators:
=
+= -> x+=3 is the same as x=x+3 (same for all of the assignment operators)
-=
*=
/=
%=
//=
**=

List: used to store multiple items(any data) in a single variable. 
list = ["apple", "banana"]
or
thislist = list(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))
- First item has index 0, the second item has index 1 etc.

insert(): inserts an item at a specific index
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist.insert(2, "watermelon")
print(thislist)

append(): add item to the end of the list
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist.append("orange")
print(thislist)

remove(): remove a specified item
pop(): removes the specified index

sort(): sorts the list alphanumerically, ascending (case sensitive)
thislist = [100, 50, 65, 82, 23]
thislist.sort()
print(thislist)

To sort descending, use (reverse = True)
thislist = ["orange", "mango", "kiwi", "pineapple", "banana"]
thislist.sort(reverse = True)
print(thislist)

copy(): You cannot copy a list simply by typing list2 = list1, because: list2 will only be a reference to list1, and changes made in list1 will automatically also be made in list2.
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
mylist = thislist.copy()
print(mylist)
or
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
mylist = list(thislist)
print(mylist)

Join Lists: There are several ways to join two or more lists
list1 = ["a", "b", "c"]
list2 = [1, 2, 3]
list3 = list1 + list2
print(list3)

list1 = ["a", "b" , "c"]
list2 = [1, 2, 3]
for x in list2:
  list1.append(x)
print(list1)

list1 = ["a", "b" , "c"]
list2 = [1, 2, 3]
list1.extend(list2)
print(list1)

List Methods:
append()	Adds an element at the end of the list
clear()	Removes all the elements from the list
copy()	Returns a copy of the list
count()	Returns the number of elements with the specified value
extend()	Add the elements of a list (or any iterable), to the end of the current list
index()	Returns the index of the first element with the specified value
insert()	Adds an element at the specified position
pop()	Removes the element at the specified position
remove()	Removes the item with the specified value
reverse()	Reverses the order of the list
